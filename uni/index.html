        <p>Online gambling has earned the growing majority of customer complaints
          in Britain’s gambling industry in a time when most online gambling
          businesses are based overseas, an analysis of a decade’s worth of
          complaints logged in company regulatory returns acquired via
          freedom of information request from the UK Gambling Commission has revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, more than 7 out of 10 complaints among all gambling operators
          were in the “remote casino, betting and bingo” sector, which includes
          online casino card games, slots, bingo and sports betting. Last year
          was the highest year on record with companies logging more
          than 100,000 complaints for the first time.

      <div class="col text">
        <p>Since 2007 the Commission has regulated the British gambling industry,
          but it was only in November 2014 after the passage of the <a
          href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/remote-gambling-bill-receives-royal-assent">
          Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Bill</a> they started regulating non-British
          based gambling companies doing business in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of online gambling companies operating in Britain are
          based overseas in countries like <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-malta-gambling-insight-idUKKBN18H0SJ">
          Malta</a>, Ireland and autonomous
          territories like <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gq89g4/the-battle-for-the-rock-224">
          Gibraltar</a>, the Isle of Man and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/04/alderney-hub-online-gambling">Channel Islands</a>.
          These regions offer more lenient regulations, lower taxes and have
          allowed the companies to avoid filing regulatory
          returns with the Commission for seven years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remote operators under the Commission‘s administration more than
          doubled once these companies were included. This was followed
          by a more than tenfold spike in complaints between 2014 and 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Commission has net an average of 10 more remote operators per year since 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
          “In simple terms, more operators means more reports of consumer complaints,” said a spokesperson from the Commission.
        </p>
      </div>

  <div class="stackedText">
    <div class="flex-grid">
      <div class="col text">
        <p>But it isn’t just the number of complaints and operators going up:
          the data reveals the average number of complaints per operator
          has increased by more than 30 percent over the last two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Growing complaint numbers in a sector can either be a sign of
          increased dissatisfaction or can indicate that complaints processes
          are more visible and easier for the consumer to access,” the spokesperson said.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than 1 out of 5 British surveyed last year said they had gambled
          or placed a bet online at least once in the last four weeks, according
          to the UK Gambling Commission survey on gambling participation, which
          marks an increase of more than double from 2012. The Commission
          estimates the online gambling sector accounted for more than 30
          percent of industry’s £13.8 billion revenue in between April 2016 and March 2017.

        <h1>Operator Who?</h1>
        <p>The Commission states its mission is “to keep crime out of gambling,
          to ensure that gambling is conducted fairly and openly, and to protect
          children and vulnerable people." Yet the Commission’s FOI office refused
          to provide the number of complaints by company even though this data
          could identify bad actors to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FOI office said the requested data on specific companies was
          “commercially sensitive information” under the Freedom of Information
          Act 2000, arguing that providing the data “could discourage licensees
          from freely providing information,” “lead to comparisons being made
          between operators” and “would put [operators] at a disadvantage to other operators.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Commission spokesperson said they use data from company regulatory
          returns, which is the source of these complaints, “to monitor compliance
          with various requirements, ensure that processes are working correctly,
          to inform policy development and to understand how
          the gambling industry is working more widely.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “We may take action depending on our findings,” the spokesperson added,
          “for example, as a result of analysing the complaints data we’ve received
          from operators in the regulatory returns we are proposing to change
          wording of the regulatory returns so the data is more accurate.”

        <h1>What's there to complain about?</h1>
        <p>
          Data from regulatory returns isn’t the only way to gauge issues
          people are having with gambling companies. The European Directive
          on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), which came into effect in
          2015, requires companies that fail to resolve a complaint to point
          the customer to a third-party ADR provider to handle the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Commission’s <a href="http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/Complaints-processes-in-the-gambling-industry.pdf">
          March 2017 Complaints Processes in the Gambling Industry report</a>,
          which was published one year into the ADR dispute
          scheme, found ADR provider Independent Betting Adjudication Service
          (IBAS) handled 93.6 percent of disputes in the gambling industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2015 and 2016, more than half of IBAS cases ruled in favor of the
          consumer or were conceded by the operator as an admission of goodwill,
          fault or offer of compromise, according to the <a href="https://www.ibas-uk.com/about-us/publications/">
          most recent data published by IBAS</a>.

          IBAS secured more than £1.2 million for consumers among the 9,595
          disputes it handled in those same years. That means someone who
          received a favorable outcome won an average of £200 pounds each.
        </p>
        <p>
          IBAS managing director Richard Hayler said the majority of disputes came from online gambling companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          “2015 was the first year that online disputes outweighed land-based disputes and it’s stayed that way since,” Hayler said.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data from IBAS is also a window into the issues customers have when
          they complain. The number one issue was promotional and bonus offers,
          which claimed more than 1 out of 5 disputes. These are offers which
          promise gamblers more bets or money if they spend a certain amount of money within a limited amount of time.

        <h1>What's to be done?</h1>
        <p>
          Though recent reports from the Gambling Commission indicate that
          Great Britain still prefers non-remote forms of gambling, the
          popularity of digital gambling continues to grow. This is
          reflected in the gambling industry’s earnings. Between 2014 and
          2016, the industry’s overall remote gambling revenue increased by
          216.87 percent. However, during the same period, complaints about
          remote gambling increased by 1674.65 percent. The disparity between
          the two percentages indicates that popularity in online gambling is
          not the only contributing factor to the rise in complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
          The increase in user complaints has been in parallel with an increase
          of nearly £18 million in fines issued by the UK Gambling Commission.
          The fines are centred around the same issues ADR providers deal with:
          deceptive advertising and social responsibility.

          Mark Griffiths, director of the International Gaming Research Unit at
          Nottingham University, explains that data collated by gambling
          companies contains the necessary information to flag at risk users,
          but is not utilised in that capacity. Currently, potential problem
          gamblers are exposed to the same advertisement experience as other
          users. He argues that “the direct promoting of marketing and advertising
          materials to players who companies pretty much know are problem
          gamblers, to me that’s just ethically irresponsible”.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a statement, a spokesman for the Gambling Commission explained said
          that “growing complaints numbers in a sector can either be a sign of
          increased dissatisfaction or can indicate that complains processes
          are move visible and easier for the consumer to access.”  Such a
          viewpoint has seemingly driven recent actions taken by the Gambling
          Commission to address issues within the industry.  In November 2017,
          the Gambling Commission released a new strategy aimed to “help shape
          a well-regulated gambling market that works for consumers.”
          In addition, to avoid any future database discrepancies, a new report
          has been introduced that expands on how to report complaints properly.
          Griffiths believes the gambling industry should be regulated with
          “protective infrastructures in place that companies can maximise fun
          for those who have no problems and minimise harm for those that have
          potential problems”. The Gambling Commission’s continuous efforts
          demonstrate steps towards enforcing these regulations.
