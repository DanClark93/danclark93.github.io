        <p>Online gambling businesses face the growing majority of customer
          complaints in Britain’s gambling industry amid a climate of increased
          regulation and fines, an analysis of a decade’s worth of company
          regulatory return data acquired via FOI from the UK Gambling Commission has revealed.

        <p>“We collect a wide range of data as regulatory returns. We use this to
           monitor compliance with various requirements, ensure that processes
           are working correctly, to inform policy development and to understand
           how the gambling industry is working more widely. We may take action
           depending on our findings, for example, as a result of analysing the
           complaints data we’ve received from operators in the regulatory returns
           we are proposing to change wording of the regulatory returns
           so the data is more accurate.“
        </p>
        <p>
          “Growing complaint numbers in a sector can either be a sign of
          increased dissatisfaction or can indicate that complaints processes
          are more visible and easier for the consumer to access. We are also
          taking steps to help operators understand the reporting requirements
          better, which should make the reports we receive more consistent. Having
          said that we have been working hard, and will continue to work hard, to
          ensure that consumers are protected. In November we unveiled a new strategy
          which will help shape a well-regulated gambling market that works for consumers.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, more than 7 out of 10 complaints among all gambling operators
          were in the “remote casino, betting and bingo” sector, which the UK
          Gambling Commission defines as online casino card games, slots, bingo
          and sports betting. Last year was the highest year on record with
          companies logging more than 100,000 complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Commission‘s FOI office refused to provide the number of complaints
          by company because it didn’t pass its public interest test, citing ““

        <p>
          And in the last two years, complaints in the online gambling sector
          have grown by an average of 38 percent. The UK Gambling Commission
          took all remote gambling operators in Britain under its jurisdiction
          and began receiving their regulatory returns in November 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          But earnings from businesses in this umbrella category claimed 34 percent
          of overall revenue in Britain’s gambling industry in 2017,
          according to the most UK Gambling Commission Industry Statistics report.

          More than 1 out of 5 British people said they had gambled or
          placed a bet online once last year, according to the April 2018
          UK Gambling Commission survey on gambling participation, which
          marks an increase of more than double from 2012. Online gambling
          accounted for 53 percent of reported gambling among those surveyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          March 2017 complaints process in the gambling industry report,
          chief executive Sarah Harrison: “In the last year we received
          nearly 77,000 contacts from members of the public. This is an
          increase of over 300 per cent on the last two years. It tells
          us that existing complaints arrangements in the sector are
          not meeting consumer needs.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The complaints come at a time when the UK Gambling Commission has
          issued more than £18 million in fines against gambling companies
          since 2016. The fines are centered around deceptive advertising and
          social responsibility, which allows gamblers to voluntarily opt-out,
          or “self-exclude,” from gambling offers.

        <h1>Remote Gambling in the UK on the rise</h1>
        <p>
          In the last three years, NHS surveys indicate that gambling in the UK
          has seen an overall marginal decrease of__ percent, but remote gambling
          has seen a small, but steady increase of __ percent . According to the
          Gambling Act of 2005, remote gambling includes television, phone, radio,
          online or “any other kind of electronic or other technology for
          facilitating communication”. As of February 2018, The Gambling
          Commission reports that laptops and mobile apps are the dominate mediums for remote gambling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prevalence of technology in the modern day has made
          gambling instant. Griffiths describes the accessibility of
          sports gambling to have transformed from a “discontinuous
          form of gambling into a continuous form of gambling”.
          Football bets used to be much more limited—often just
          one bet per match on the outcome. The Internet,
          however, has expanded the versatility of sports
          betting so that betting multiple times per match has become common practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The popularity of digital gambling is reflected in the gambling
          industry’s earnings. Between 2014 and 2016 the industry’s overall
          remote gambling revenue increased by 216.87 percent. However,
          during the same period, complaints about remote gambling increased
          by 1674.65 percent. This disparity indicates that popularity in
          online gambling is not the only contributing factor to the rise in complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology has turned more forms of gambling into what is referred
          to as high event frequency gambling. In sports betting, for instance,
          on days that matches are streamed back to back, there is increased
          opportunities and reminders to place bets. Technology encourages
          continuous gambling by providing the gambling industry a growing platform for
          advertisements and, subsequently, users are subjected to increased exposure.

  <div class="stackedText">

      <div class="col text">
        <h1>Advertising/Promotional offers and social responsibility</h1>
        <p>
          The practice of consistently exposing the public to frequent gambling
          advertisements and promotional offers risks customer exploitation. Both
          threaten to mislead the client, often featuring convoluted rhetoric frequent
          in legal documents. Promotional offers tend to be similarly formatted across
          the industry, so seasoned gamblers will be familiar with the vocabulary.
          However, flashy appearances and promising sums create a risk that newcomers
          will sign up without fully understanding the offer and the probability of
          winning. Such an environment raises legal and ethical concerns
          about the gambling industry’s practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to UK’s advertising and media laws, The Gambling Commission
          and the Industry Group for Responsible Gambling (IGRG) have administered
          regulations specifically monitoring the ethical standards of the gambling
          industry. The introduction of IGRG’s Gambling industry code outlines that
          the aim is to “provide gambling operators with a range of measures that
          would enhance the social responsibility of their advertising and which
          went over and above the extensive requirements already placed on them
          by the gambling and advertising regulators”. Hayler does not believe
          there is a widespread issue of predatory behaviour necessarily, rather
          “there is a wide range of people taking part in these offers with a very
          broad range of skills and experience in the sector”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Potential problem gamblers are exposed to the same advertisement experience.
          Griffiths explains that data collated by gambling companies contains the
          necessary information to flag at risk users, but is not utilised in that
          capacity. He argues that “the direct promoting of marketing and advertising
          materials to players who companies pretty much know are problem gamblers,
          to me that’s just ethically irresponsible”.  It is apparent that the gambling
          industry has the means to foster a safe and equal environment for all gamblers.
          The issue that remains is not whether there is enough regulation in place,
          but whether it is enforced.
