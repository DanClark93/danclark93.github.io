        <p>Online gambling has earned the growing majority of customer complaints
          in Britain’s gambling industry in a time when most online gambling
          businesses are based overseas, an analysis of a decade’s worth of
          complaints logged in company regulatory returns acquired via
          freedom of information request from the UK Gambling Commission has revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, more than 7 out of 10 complaints among all gambling operators
          were in the “remote casino, betting and bingo” sector, which includes
          online casino card games, slots, bingo and sports betting. Last year
          was the highest year on record with companies logging more
          than 100,000 complaints for the first time.

      <div class="col text">
        <p>Since 2007 the Commission has regulated the British gambling industry,
          but it was only in November 2014 after the passage of the <a
          href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/remote-gambling-bill-receives-royal-assent">
          Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Bill</a> they started regulating non-British
          based gambling companies doing business in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of online gambling companies operating in Britain are
          based overseas in countries like <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-malta-gambling-insight-idUKKBN18H0SJ">
          Malta</a>, Ireland and autonomous
          territories like <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gq89g4/the-battle-for-the-rock-224">
          Gibraltar</a>, the Isle of Man and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/04/alderney-hub-online-gambling">Channel Islands</a>.
          These regions offer more lenient regulations, lower taxes and have
          allowed the companies to avoid filing regulatory
          returns with the Commission for seven years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remote operators under the Commission‘s administration more than
          doubled once these companies were included. This was followed
          by a more than tenfold spike in complaints between 2014 and 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Commission has net an average of 10 more remote operators per year since 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
          “In simple terms, more operators means more reports of consumer complaints,” said a spokesperson from the Commission.
        </p>

      <div class="col text">
        <p>But it isn’t just the number of complaints and operators going up:
          the data reveals the average number of complaints per operator
          has increased by more than 30 percent over the last two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Growing complaint numbers in a sector can either be a sign of
          increased dissatisfaction or can indicate that complaints processes
          are more visible and easier for the consumer to access,” the spokesperson said.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than 1 out of 5 British surveyed last year said they had gambled
          or placed a bet online at least once in the last four weeks, according
          to the UK Gambling Commission survey on gambling participation, which
          marks an increase of more than double from 2012. The Commission
          estimates the online gambling sector accounted for more than 30
          percent of industry’s £13.8 billion revenue in between April 2016 and March 2017.

        <h1>Operator Who?</h1>
        <p>The Commission states its mission is “to keep crime out of gambling,
          to ensure that gambling is conducted fairly and openly, and to protect
          children and vulnerable people." Yet the Commission’s FOI office refused
          to provide the number of complaints by company even though this data
          could identify bad actors to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FOI office said the requested data on specific companies was
          “commercially sensitive information” under the Freedom of Information
          Act 2000, arguing that providing the data “could discourage licensees
          from freely providing information,” “lead to comparisons being made
          between operators” and “would put [operators] at a disadvantage to other operators.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Commission spokesperson said they use data from company regulatory
          returns, which is the source of these complaints, “to monitor compliance
          with various requirements, ensure that processes are working correctly,
          to inform policy development and to understand how
          the gambling industry is working more widely.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “We may take action depending on our findings,” the spokesperson added,
          “for example, as a result of analysing the complaints data we’ve received
          from operators in the regulatory returns we are proposing to change
          wording of the regulatory returns so the data is more accurate.”

        <h1>What's there to complain about?</h1>
        <p>
          Data from regulatory returns isn’t the only way to gauge issues
          people are having with gambling companies. The European Directive
          on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), which came into effect in
          2015, requires companies that fail to resolve a complaint to point
          the customer to a third-party ADR provider to handle the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Commission’s <a href="http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/Complaints-processes-in-the-gambling-industry.pdf">
          March 2017 Complaints Processes in the Gambling Industry report</a>,
          which was published one year into the ADR dispute
          scheme, found ADR provider Independent Betting Adjudication Service
          (IBAS) handled 93.6 percent of disputes in the gambling industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2015 and 2016, more than half of IBAS cases ruled in favor of the
          consumer or were conceded by the operator as an admission of goodwill,
          fault or offer of compromise, according to the <a href="https://www.ibas-uk.com/about-us/publications/">
          most recent data published by IBAS</a>.

          IBAS secured more than £1.2 million for consumers among the 9,595
          disputes it handled in those same years. That means someone who
          received a favorable outcome won an average of £200 pounds each.
        </p>
        <p>
          IBAS managing director Richard Hayler said the majority of disputes came from online gambling companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          “2015 was the first year that online disputes outweighed land-based disputes and it’s stayed that way since,” Hayler said.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data from IBAS is also a window into the issues customers have when
          they complain. The number one issue was promotional and bonus offers, which claimed more than 1 out of 5 disputes.

        <p>
          These issues gamblers have with online operators come at a time when the UK
          Gambling Commission has issued more than £18 million in fines against
          gambling companies since 2016. The fines are centered around the same
          issues ADR providers deal with: deceptive advertising and social
          responsibility, which allows gamblers to voluntarily opt-out, or “self-exclude,” from gambling offers.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The source of these investigations varies from case to case – some
          come as a result of operators informing us and others come as a result
          of complaints from consumers,” the Commission spokesperson said.

        <h1>Remote Gambling in the UK on the rise</h1>
        <p>
          In the last three years, NHS surveys indicate that gambling in the UK
          has seen an overall marginal decrease of__ percent, but remote gambling
          has seen a small, but steady increase of __ percent . According to the
          Gambling Act of 2005, remote gambling includes television, phone, radio,
          online or “any other kind of electronic or other technology for
          facilitating communication”. As of February 2018, The Gambling
          Commission reports that laptops and mobile apps are the dominate mediums for remote gambling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prevalence of technology in the modern day has made
          gambling instant. Griffiths describes the accessibility of
          sports gambling to have transformed from a “discontinuous
          form of gambling into a continuous form of gambling”.
          Football bets used to be much more limited—often just
          one bet per match on the outcome. The Internet,
          however, has expanded the versatility of sports
          betting so that betting multiple times per match has become common practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The popularity of digital gambling is reflected in the gambling
          industry’s earnings. Between 2014 and 2016 the industry’s overall
          remote gambling revenue increased by 216.87 percent. However,
          during the same period, complaints about remote gambling increased
          by 1674.65 percent. This disparity indicates that popularity in
          online gambling is not the only contributing factor to the rise in complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology has turned more forms of gambling into what is referred
          to as high event frequency gambling. In sports betting, for instance,
          on days that matches are streamed back to back, there is increased
          opportunities and reminders to place bets. Technology encourages
          continuous gambling by providing the gambling industry a growing platform for
          advertisements and, subsequently, users are subjected to increased exposure.
        </p>
      </div>

  <!--Advertising/Promotional offers and social responsibility section-->
  <div class="stackedText">
    <div class="flex-grid">
      <div class="col text">
        <h1>Advertising/Promotional offers and social responsibility</h1>
        <p>
          The practice of consistently exposing the public to frequent gambling
          advertisements and promotional offers risks customer exploitation. Both
          threaten to mislead the client, often featuring convoluted rhetoric frequent
          in legal documents. Promotional offers tend to be similarly formatted across
          the industry, so seasoned gamblers will be familiar with the vocabulary.
          However, flashy appearances and promising sums create a risk that newcomers
          will sign up without fully understanding the offer and the probability of
          winning. Such an environment raises legal and ethical concerns
          about the gambling industry’s practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to UK’s advertising and media laws, The Gambling Commission
          and the Industry Group for Responsible Gambling (IGRG) have administered
          regulations specifically monitoring the ethical standards of the gambling
          industry. The introduction of IGRG’s Gambling industry code outlines that
          the aim is to “provide gambling operators with a range of measures that
          would enhance the social responsibility of their advertising and which
          went over and above the extensive requirements already placed on them
          by the gambling and advertising regulators”. Hayler does not believe
          there is a widespread issue of predatory behaviour necessarily, rather
          “there is a wide range of people taking part in these offers with a very
          broad range of skills and experience in the sector”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Potential problem gamblers are exposed to the same advertisement experience.
          Griffiths explains that data collated by gambling companies contains the
          necessary information to flag at risk users, but is not utilised in that
          capacity. He argues that “the direct promoting of marketing and advertising
          materials to players who companies pretty much know are problem gamblers,
          to me that’s just ethically irresponsible”.  It is apparent that the gambling
          industry has the means to foster a safe and equal environment for all gamblers.
          The issue that remains is not whether there is enough regulation in place,
          but whether it is enforced.
